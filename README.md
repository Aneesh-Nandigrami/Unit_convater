# Digital Clock

A simple, stylish digital clock built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and the date with day and month names, updating every second.

## 📂 Project Structure



## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time clock** that updates every second.
- Displays **hours, minutes, and seconds**.
- Shows **day of the week**, **month name**, and **date**.
- **Responsive layout** with gradient and shadow effects.
- Clean and minimal **UI design**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (gradients, positioning, shadows)
- **JavaScript** for live date & time updates

## 📜 How It Works
1. `index.html` contains the clock layout with placeholders for time and date.
2. `style.css` adds styling such as gradients, colors, and responsive positioning.
3. `script.js` uses JavaScript’s `Date()` object to fetch and display the current time and date, refreshing every second with `setInterval()`.
